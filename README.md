# Elideus | DotNet Framework

**Elideus-DotNet-Framework** is a NuGet package used in my personal projects.

It consists of 1 core package and 4 additional packages that can be used independently:

- [Core](https://github.com/eliseubatista99/Elideus-DotNet-Framework/tree/main/ElideusDotNetFramework/ElideusDotNetFramework.Core): The package with the basic application functionalities;
- [Database](https://github.com/eliseubatista99/Elideus-DotNet-Framework/tree/main/ElideusDotNetFramework/ElideusDotNetFramework.Database): The package with the basic database functionalities;
- [Database.PostgreSql](https://github.com/eliseubatista99/Elideus-DotNet-Framework/tree/main/ElideusDotNetFramework/ElideusDotNetFramework.Database.PostgreSql): This package extends the Database package with functionalities specific for integration with the PostgreSQL environment;
- [ExternalServices](https://github.com/eliseubatista99/Elideus-DotNet-Framework/tree/main/ElideusDotNetFramework/ElideusDotNetFramework.ExternalServices): This package provides the functionality needed to interact with external applications using `HttpClient`;
- [Tests](https://github.com/eliseubatista99/Elideus-DotNet-Framework/tree/main/ElideusDotNetFramework/ElideusDotNetFramework.Tests): This package includes the boilerplate needed to mock and execute tests for an application.

The framework is designed to be modular, allowing you to choose which packages best suit your needs. Each package serves a different purpose, whether it's core application logic, database management, interaction with external services, or testing.
